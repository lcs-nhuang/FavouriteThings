    I love my parents very much and they love me very much. This photo was taken when I was five years old and we were traveling. It can be seen that I am very uncooperative in this photo.ðŸ¥¸

    I think family is an indispensable part of everyone's life. My parents have given me a lot of support and love since I was born, and I really appreciate them. Lucy is also part of my family, but she hadn't joined our family when this photo was taken.
