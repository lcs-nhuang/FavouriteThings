    Hot pot is one of my favorite Chinese food. It is like a boiling pot of soup. We blanch the ingredients and eat them with sauce. What I described may not be that delicious, but trust me, it taste really good.
    
    There are many delicious foods in China, many of which donâ€™t even have English names, but this does not prevent me from loving them.
