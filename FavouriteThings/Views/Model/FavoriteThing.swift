     Icecream is one of my favorite food and I love strawberry icecream so much. I can eat a bucket of strawberry icecream in 3 minutes.

     I'm just kidding. I can't eat that much.
    
     ps. Coconut and pineapple haagen-Dazs are also very good. You can find them in FoodLandüòã

    I love my parents very much and they love me very much. This photo was taken when I was five years old and we were traveling. It can be seen that I am very uncooperative in this photo.ü•∏

    I think family is an indispensable part of everyone's life. My parents have given me a lot of support and love since I was born, and I really appreciate them. Lucy is also part of my family, but she hadn't joined our family when this photo was taken.

    Hot pot is one of my favorite Chinese food. It is like a boiling pot of soup. We blanch the ingredients and eat them with sauce. What I described may not be that delicious, but trust me, it taste really good.
    
    There are many delicious foods in China, many of which don‚Äôt even have English names, but this does not prevent me from loving them.
